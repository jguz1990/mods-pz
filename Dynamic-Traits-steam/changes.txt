B) traitsByMovingObjects function is now called in the EveryOneMinute (for optimization purposes only, more will be moved). File affected: DTMainFile.lua, DTByOtherConditions.lua

On Steam, Update May 14 2022:
A) Added loggers across the entire mod (monitoring the mod behaviour). The logs can be seen in the console.log. The functions that still runs based on OnPlayerUpdate event won't have logs yet.
   - Track if the functions are being properly executed (For example, if Anorexy is present, there are logs for the Anorexy functions).
   - Track of the ModData values changes (For example, if Smoker is present and the player doesn't smoke, that the ModData increases as expected).
B) Added a check for More Simple Traits. If detected active, then the DoTrait function from that mod will be called to avoid possible bugs with the Mutually Exclusives traits.
C) New Traits: Nervous Wreck and Melancholic. Files affected: DTByOtherConditions, DTMainCreationMethods, DTmodifiers.lua, DTMainFile.lua
   - Both are Dynamic Traits BUT will only affect who choosed them at the start (if you didn't pick them in the character creation then you won't ever have to deal with them).
   - Nervous Wreck can be treated with Betablockers, Melancholic can be treated with Antidepressants (one per day is enough to keep them always removed).
   - DTPillsBeta(Nervous Wreck) and DTPillsAntiDep(Melancholic) are the internal values for the traits. While the value is under or equals to 24 the traits are not present. Above 24 the traits are added. (It increases one per hour and decreases in 24 each time a pill is taken).
   - Having the traits will increase in 30% all the Stress and Unhappyness gains from others traits. Example: the Unhappyness and Stress generated by Alcoholic will be 30% higher if the traits are present.
   - Passively if the traits are present, each hour the unhappyness and stress will increase.
   - If no pills are taken the value will keep increasing up to 240 (10 days) so to remove the traits, 10 pills would be required.
D) Taken too many pills will generate overdose, which will generate poison. Files affected: DTMainFile.lua, DTByOtherConditions.lua
   - Each taken pill increases in 8 DTPillsOverdose. DTPillsOverdose will decrease in 1 each hour.
   - Every ten minutes the value of DTPillsOverdose is checked. If greater than 24, will generate poison in a chance of 1 in 7. The poison will be a random number generated between 0 and the current value of DTPillsOverdose. The traits that affect the poison in other traits affect here too.
E) Due to the Pills overdose, the fatigue reduction by taking vitamins was increased from 2 to 7 (to make them worth it).

   - Instead of looking for specific Strength and Fitness Levels it will check for the Strength and Fitness Traits to add/remove traits.

   - Slighly changed how it works. Instead of the code being executed in the update function(that runs per tick) it will now be executed in the perform function(that runs once the item is moved). This will allow two things: the first one is that everyone will increase the same amount when moving objects (as the update runs every tick and the tick is attached to FPS, higher FPS meant getting the trait faster), the second one is that as now the code will be executed when the item is fully moved, it won't care the game speed, it will always increase in the same amount.
   - The amount will now increased based on a base value that will be multiplied by the item weight, so heavier objects will increase more.
   - Everything else works as always.
