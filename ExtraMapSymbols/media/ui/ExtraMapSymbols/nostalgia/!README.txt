ExtraMapSymbols Nostalgia
=========================

This directory contains old symbol versions, which are no longer used by ExtraMapSymbols.

They can be freely used in your own mod in whatever way you need them, or any other project (including those unrelated to Project Zomboid) without asking for permission.
All files are provided as-is; as they have been made with the Project Zomboid worldmap in mind, versions with better quality/higher resolution do not exists.

Thank you for using our mods!
